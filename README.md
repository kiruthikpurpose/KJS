# KJS Framework

KJS is a lightweight and flexible JavaScript framework designed for building modern web applications. It offers a simple API, powerful reactivity, and a component-based architecture.

## Features

* **Virtual DOM**: Efficiently updates the UI by minimizing direct DOM manipulation.
* **Reactivity System**: Automatically tracks dependencies and updates the UI when data changes.
* **Component-based Architecture**: Encapsulate UI and logic in reusable components.
* **Routing**: Supports single-page application (SPA) navigation with dynamic routing.
* **State Management**: Centralized store for global state management, making it easy to share data across components.
* **Error Handling**: Built-in error boundaries to catch and manage errors gracefully.
* **Utility Functions**: Includes useful utilities for debouncing, throttling, and deep cloning.
* **Example Application**: Comes with an example app to demonstrate usage and best practices.

## Experimental Nature

This framework serves as a **simple project** to explore the capabilities of AI in software development. It has been developed with substantial assistance from **ChatGPT**, which helped generate ideas, understand necessary components, and refine the architecture. 

KJS is intended to showcase what AI can achieve in the realm of web development and to experiment with its potential. As such, it is not aimed at production use but rather as a foundation for learning and exploration.
